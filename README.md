# Library of Notifications via email using phpMailer

This library has the function of sending e-mail using a phpmailer library. Doing this in an uncomplicated way is essential for any system.

To install the library, run the following command:

``` sh
composer requires gustavoweb / composer_teste
```

To make use of the library, simply request the composer's autoload, invoke the class and make a method call:

``` sh
<? php

requires __DIR__. '/vendor/autoload.php';

USE Notification \ Email;

$ email = new Email (2, "mail.host.com", "your@email.com", "your-pass", "smtp secure (tls / ssl)", "port (587)",
    "from@email.com", "From name");

$ email-> sendEmail ("SUbject", "Content", "reply@email.com", "Replay Name", "address@email.com", "Address Name");
```

Note that the entire configuration of sending the email is using the magic method builder! Once the builder method has been invoked within your application, your system will be able to take the shots.
